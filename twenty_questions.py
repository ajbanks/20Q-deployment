Hey, I am interested in buying some clothes
Agent
Hello, I’d be happy to assist you in finding the right products. Could you please provide some more information?
Is there a special event or activity you want to find an outfit for? Customer
I just want a new outfit for this weekend
you
We have a variety of clothing in stock,
shall we start by getting you the right trousers,
top and jacket combination?
Customer
That sounds good, although it’s still quite warm,
so shorts and a blouse will be enough.
you
We have a variety of patterns and colours in our collection of shorts. Do you prefer a solid colour, denim, striped, all-over pattern? Do you have any similar preferences for a blouse?
For example, a lighter-coloured blouse could work well with denim shorts. Customer
The denim shorts sound good, maybe with a white blouse?
you
Great choice!
Here is the denim shorts and white blouse combination for your weekend
